HTTP requests are never displayed to the user (if you want to see them, you need  to use tools such as the Firefox [Network Monitor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor) or the Chrome [Developer Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools)). For more information visit this [page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data).
