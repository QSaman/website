### Youtube

* To add Personal YouTube API key follow this [tutorial](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=267160&pid=2299960#pid2299960)
* The YouTube API no longer supports the full use of Watch Later and History preventing correct syncing and editing. For a workaround follow this [tutotial](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=267160&pid=2299963#pid2299963). Basically you add a new playlist (e.g. "Kodi watch later") and tell YouTube plugin to use this playlist as watch-later. You can also tell to the plugin to remove videos from it after you watched them.
